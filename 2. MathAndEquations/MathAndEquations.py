print(50/5) # Operations can be printed with the retrieved results.

5 != 10 # This is an example of boolean comparison. In this case we can see an equation which will return "true" if it is in fact true and "false" otherwise.

print(11*2 == 22 * 1) # We can also print the result of it.

print(31 >= 10*4) # Another example of boolean comparison.
